            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170344:4"/>is very hurtful to the Vine in the field where it is planted, for it ſucks out the nouriſhment of the earth, not leaving enough for the Vine; and the leaves of it are ſo thick, that they make a dark ſhade, drawing Paſſengers to it, who to beat down the fruit, tread down and spoil the Vine: of this nature are all worldly vanities to the ſoul, wherein fooliſh men pride themſelves; while the thoughts run out after them, a mans whole time is taken up with them, many ſtrong temptations aſſault him, and his heart is trodden down and spoiled: In brief, Pride baniſheth heavenly love and the fear of God out of the heart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebleth the spirit, and blemiſheth a mans repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and though it be the ſport of the world, yet is it the bane of the heart: Pride is a fornace, whoſe mouth is ſelf-conceitedneſs, the flame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the sparkles contemptuous words, the ſmoak an evil name, the aſhes miſery, and the end ſhame: but on the contrary; they that write of husbandry tell us, that if one write any word upon a ſound Almond, and put it into its ſhell, binding it well, and ſetting it into the earth, all the fruit of that tree will grow with that word imprinted in it: So alſo whoſoever hath humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his heart, ſhall have it alſo grow up with him in his outward actions; and as the life ſprings from the heart, the Almond from the kernel, it will bring forth all the actions that are the fruits thereof with humility ſtampt upon it, which will be ſeen in a mans eyes, lips, veſtures, geſtures, and in all his carriage.</p>

               <p>MY purpoſe (God aſſiſting me) is from this Text, to handle this great ſin of Pride: And firſt I ſhall define it, though I confeſs that it is a ſin ſo great, that I can hardly give a full definition of it. I have read of <hi>Apelles,</hi>

And therefore ſaith <hi>Hugo,</hi> Pride is a vitious haughtineſs, whereby a man deſpiſeth his inferiours, and earneſtly buſieth himſelf to rule over his equals, and thoſe alſo that are above him. In the ſecond Crown was written, <hi>Non obedio,</hi> I obey no others; becauſe Pride would give Laws to others, but obey none himſelf. In the third was written, <hi>Perturbo,</hi> I trouble all; and we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the pride of ſome perſons doth trouble a whole Nation.

Did man conſider his many ſins, and daily tranſgreſſions, his inability to ſtand, his readineſs to fall, the corruption of his birth, the wickedneſs and miſery of his life, and the uncertainty of his death; did he conſider, that what good ſoever he hath, it is not his own; and what he hath he may loſe, if not rightly uſed; and that one day he muſt be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what he hath received; then would he finde little cauſe to be proud of any thing. The more wiſdom a man hath, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it will make him; and the more ignorant he is, the more proud. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Job 28.13.</note> 
                  <hi>That wiſdom is not to be found in the land of the living;</hi> the Chaldee Paraphraſt tranſlates thus, Neither is it found in the land of proud livers, or of thoſe who in their lives are proud ſinners:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170344:15"/>They that have leaſt wiſdom, leaſt grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly think they have moſt; and they that have moſt, ſee the moſt want.

               <p n="3">3. A third cauſe of Pride in many men, is, from the flattering applauſe of others. When mens parts and learning,
<note place="margin">

When <hi>Herod</hi> made an eloquent Oration to the people, they gave a ſhout,
<note place="margin">Act. 12.22, 23.</note> ſaying, <hi>It the voyce of a God, and not of a man:</hi> This vain applauſe of the people, pufft up his heart with pride, making him to give that glory to himſelf, that was due to God.

A blinde man heareth the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170344:15"/>good that is ſaid of him, but perceiveth not the hurt and evil that is meant towards him; and it many times fals out, that thoſe that love to be flattered for their vertues, are alſo (as a juſt plague and puniſhment upon them) flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their ſins. It is a great weakneſs in any man to delight in ſuch perſons, being the moſt pernicious people in the world, keeping a man ever from the true knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and they will follow him no longer then they can get by him, like the Celedony ſtone, that loſeth its vertue, unleſs it be rubbed with gold; or like the Ivy, that ſucks out the ſap of the Oak that ſupports it: They deal with a man, as a man doth with a candle, carry it while it ſerves his turn, and hurl it away when it is like to burn his fingers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth cauſe of Pride is the Devil: The true Original of all Pride is Satan himſelf; through his ſin, it was the firſt ſin that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſome think. God did diſcover to the Angels,

But whatever the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar object of it was, it is moſt probable that it was the ſin of Pride. When the ſeventy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which our Saviour had ſent out to work miracles, and to preach, returned again with joy, ſaying, <hi>Lord,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.17, 18.</note> even the Devils are ſubject unto us through thy name:</hi> He ſaid unto them, <hi>I beheld Satan as lighting fall from heaven.</hi> Some are of opinion, that our Saviour ſpake

<note place="margin">Gregor. Theophil.</note> whereof ye may read <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Superbia eſt caput antiqui Serpentis.</note> that <hi>Michael and his Angel fought againſt the Dragon and his Angels;</hi> and in fight prevailed ſo, that there was no more place found in Heaven, either for the Dragon himſelf, or for his Angels, but he was caſt out, and they with him; and this fall (no queſtion) Chriſt Jeſus was an eye-witneſs and beholder of in his Divinity, being that <hi>Michael</hi> there ſpoken of, who gave him the fall, and threw him down; and thus they take the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Chriſt to be a caveat to theſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to take heed of being infected with pride, occaſioned by their proſperous ſucceſs, from this fearful example. Some ſay, the Devil hath in him every ſin <hi>ſecundum reatum,</hi>

But though it be not his proper ſin, yet it is his ſpecial ſin; and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith, <hi>As proud as</hi> Lucifer. Men uſe to parallel a proud perſon with the Devil, and no ſinner beſides; and it is an undoubted chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a childe of the Devil, in whomſoever it domineereth: And for that cauſe, Satan (like that great <hi>Leviathan</hi>) may be called the King over all the children of Pride.

               </head>
               <p>PRide of hair is to be ſeen three ways; in plaited hair, long hair, and borrowed hair.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In plaited hair, which is expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Apoſtle: Speaking to women, he ſaith, <hi>Whoſe adorning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Souldiers were called <hi>Comatimilities,</hi> becauſe they trimmed their hair as if they had gone to the games of <hi>Olympia.</hi>
                  </note> Which by the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Interpreters is conceived to mean all that artificial dreſſing of the head and hair beyond its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe, meerly for vain oftentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The natural uſe of hair is to be a covering; now when perſons alter the form of it, by frizzeling, plaiting, and curling of it, this is unwarrantable. <hi>Hierom</hi> expreſly condemneth the hanging the hair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the forehead. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us that it was uſual among the Romans, when a woman was to be dreſſed at a wedding, that they did plait and divide the hair of her head with the point of a ſpear, to ſhew how much they hated curioſity in dreſſing. <hi>Cauſin</hi> ſaid of ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, When was it that a dozen of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had taken from them one hair of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In long hair: We read of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170344:33"/>Locuſts,
<note place="margin">Rev. 9.8.</note> that they had hair as the hair of women; not that it is unlawful for women to have long hair,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.15.</note> for long hair is <hi>a praiſe to a woman, and is given to her for a covering,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; but in reſpect of the abuſe of it by men: For though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>It is a ſhame for a man to wear long hair,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coma longa apud Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos in viris erat ſignum luctus.</hi> Plut. Mor. 1.560.</note> and nature it ſelf teacheth that leſſon; yet ſo effeminate are many men, that their hair is as the hair of women for the length of it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth not prohibit a man to nouriſh his hair a little for his health ſake, as is the cuſtom in cold Countreys; but diſcommendeth thoſe that cut it not at all, or wear it of too great a length, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did, whoſe hair afterwards proved his deſtruction; for he was hanged up in an Oak by the goldy locks of pride, whom many young men, and ſome old men now a days do imitate.

I ſhall not uſe any bitter invectives againſt this ſort of men, but (as that good old Servant of Chriſt Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> ſometimes ſaid) if we can preach them into Chriſt, they will cut off their long hair.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In borrowed hair: And here is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the folly of many men in theſe days, that cover over one ſort with another, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170344:33"/>change the colour of the hair given them by God, by wearing Periwigs of another colour,
<note place="margin">

Now this which they think is their glory, is their ſhame. To ſuch men <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks to the purpoſe, Wilt thou alter the workmanſhip of God, and think to eſcape the judgement of God?

The labour to get worldly riches is long, but their uſe is ſhort; and he that taketh greateſt pains to gather them, hath often times leaſt uſe and pleaſure of them; and thoſe goods that are gotten by ſhifts, are (for the moſt part) loſt with ſhame.

                  <p n="1">1. The firſt was the departing of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> So ſaith

                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond, was the fall of the Empire in the Weſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 471. in the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtulus:</hi> Of whom this Epigram was made,
<q>
                        <l>Auguſtus Romanum imperium condidit,</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtus</hi> founded the Roman Empire, <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> deſtroyed it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third was a Charter made by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> Emperour of the Eaſt, to <hi>Benedict</hi> the ſecond; <hi>viz.</hi> That they might chuſe a Pope without the Emperour, which before they could not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth was the Amity between <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Pipin</hi> Governour of <hi>France,</hi> who ruled for <hi>Childerick,</hi> and ſent to Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> to be reſolved in this doubt, Whether it were fit for him to be King, that had the Name and Dignity, or he that bare the burthen. He preſently picked out the meaning, and ſaid, He that bare the burthen; then <hi>Pipin</hi> laboureth to depoſe his Maſter, and doth ſo.

                  <p n="5">5. The fifth ſtep was, the decay of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Empire, <hi>Anno,</hi> 756.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth ſtep was, the Tranſlation of the Roman Empire from the Greeks to the French or Germans, in the perſon of <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Charls</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth him:) for the Romans making inſurrection againſt Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the third, becauſe of his deteſtable pride, the ſaid <hi>Charls,</hi> the Son and Heir of <hi>Pepin,</hi> coming with his Army into <hi>Italy</hi> again, freed the Pope: Hereupon the Pope not to be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (out of the fulneſs of his power) gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Charls</hi> the Title of the Roman Empire (the which belonged to the Greeks, and therefore was not his to diſpoſe of) crowning him Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Weſt. On the other hand, <hi>Charls</hi> the new Emperour to gratifie the Pope, forced the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſwear fidelity to <hi>Leo,</hi> and appointed him Lord of <hi>Rome;</hi> the which Donation, <hi>Lodowick</hi> Son of <hi>Charls,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed and encreaſed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeventh ſtep, was the Conſtitution of Electors of the future Emperours, enacted by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, both Germans and Kinſmen.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The eighth ſtep reacheth to Heaven: for thus they teach, <hi>Chriſtus be ato Petro aeternae vitae clavigero, terreni ſimul &amp; coeleſtis imperii

               </head>
               <p>CHildren, eſpecially to Mothers, whoſe affections are very ſtrong, are very taking things, being little images of themſelves: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents take ſo much delight in their children, that the evils of children affect them, as if they were their own. How earneſtly doth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan</hi> cry out to Chriſt for her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
<note place="margin">Matth. 15.21.</note> You read likewiſe of a man crying out to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, I beſeech thee behold my ſon, for he is all that I have,</hi> Luke 9.38. <hi>Behold my ſon,</hi> that is, have mercy on my ſon; as it is expounded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.15. And ſo ſometimes <hi>videre</hi> is taken for <hi>reſpicere,</hi> and <hi>reſpicere</hi> for <hi>miſereri ſeu delectari,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. Parents are apt to dote too much upon an only ſon, therefore when they are taken away, the grief of Parents is exceſſive. The greateſt mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture, is ſet out by the mourning for an only ſon: Indeed, ſome there are, whoſe affections are ſo ſtrong to their children, that they take it heavily, if God take away but one of many children from them. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a doleful accident, that befell a poor man in his time, who had five ſons, and knew not how to relieve himſelf and them in a famine, unleſs he ſold one, to buy food for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170344:56"/>the reſt: On a time, with a heavy heart, he called them all about him, to ſee which he might beſt ſpare: He looketh upon his eldeſt ſon,
<note place="margin">It is engrafted in the hearts of Parents, by the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be loving, and pittiful, and kind to their children; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in his Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. only bids children be dutiful to their Parents in the fifth Commandment, but ſaith nothing to Parents to be careful for their children, knowing it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to them by a kind of natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and therefore they need no teaching for it. Luke 7.12.</note> and thought he was beſt able to ſhift; but ſhall he part with him that was the ſtrength of his youth, and the firſt that called him father? he cannot endure it; then he looketh upon his youngeſt, and thinketh how he may part with him; and alas, he faith, he was the Neſt-chick, and dearly beloved of his deceaſed mother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt not go; a third reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his Anceſtors and Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, having the Grandfathers neb, and the Grandmothers eye, and in him they ſhould live, when he was dead, and therefore he muſt not go, whatever came on it; the fourth hath been ever loving to him, and the fifth moſt diligent, dutiful, and induſtrious; ſo that the poor man can ſpare never a one of his Olive plants from about his table. And if a man could not part with one of many, what a grief (think we) was it to the poor widow of <hi>Naim,</hi> to part with one and all? ſhe being not a young wife neither, that might have many moe, but an old widow, utterly without hope of iſſue.</p>
               <p>Hath God given you many children, pride not your ſelves in them: Men are apt to glory in them, becauſe they bear their names, their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170344:56"/>reſemblance, and they do, as it were, live in their children, when themſelves are dead; they are the Parents multiplied. Haſt thou many children? thou haſt alſo many cares for them, and many ſorrows about them: If thy children are good, thou art ſtill in fear of loſing them; if evil, thou art in continual ſorrow for them; and till thou knoweſt how they will prove, thy ſolace is ambiguous, and thy care is certain. Many good men have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted in their children; as <hi>Adam, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Jacob, Eli, David,</hi> and others. Glory not then in the multitude, beauty, ſtrength and comelineſs of thy children; for God can eaſily take them all away, as he did <hi>Jobs</hi> children, and all at once. Thus God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens <hi>Ephraim,</hi> glorying in his children, <hi>Their glory ſhall flee away like a bird, from the birth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.11.</note> 
                  <hi>from the womb, &amp; from the conception: though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, and there ſhall not be a man left.</hi> Many fond and indulgent Parents, are like the Ape, that killeth its young with hugging them.

Our Fathers and Mothers have proved our murtherers, ſoul-murtherers, worſe then they who murther the body, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaketh. When Parents too much dote upon their children, they take a quick way to bereave themſelves of them. We read that <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and doted more upon him then upon all his children,
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.3.</note> therefore the Lord bereaves him of his <hi>Joſeph</hi> (that lay ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170344:57"/>near to his heart) for many years together, and then his ſorrow was as great for the loſs of him, as he took delight and contentment in the enjoyment of him. It is the greatneſs of our affections,
<note place="margin">Woodw. Childs Patrim.</note> as one well obſerveth, that cauſeth the greatneſs of our afflictions. They that love too much, will always grieve too much: It is good for Parents ſo to delight themſelves in their children, as that they could be ready and willing to part with them; and then, with <hi>Job,</hi> they will bleſs God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for giving them, but alſo for taking them away. He was a wiſe Heathen that ſaid, <hi>I kiſs my childe to day, and then I think it may be dead to morrow.</hi> Love your children only as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and let not the Mothers childe, be the Mothers God; nor the Fathers ſon, be the Fathers Idol. <hi>Eli</hi> honoured his ſons more then God; therefore God ſaid, <hi>there ſhould not be an old man in his houſe for ever,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30, 31, 32, 33, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his houſe ſhould dye in the flower of his age; and this ſhould be a ſign unto him, that his twoſons,</hi> Hophni <hi>and</hi> Phinehas, <hi>ſhould both of them dye in one day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Parents imitate thoſe that brought their little children unto Chriſt, that he might touch them, and bleſs them: Let them bring their children to Chriſt, and offer them to God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Luke 18.15.</note> By prayer, for his bleſſing upon them: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed even for <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Gen. 17.18. There's no queſtion, but <hi>Job</hi> prayed as well as offered ſacrifice for his children, leſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170344:57"/>they might forget themſelves and offend God in their feaſtings. This muſt be a daily duty of Parents, and continued act ſo long as they and their children live upon earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are to be offered to God by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in the face of the congregation ſo ſoon as conveniently they may: If a Father knew he had ſome ſpecial friend that had caſt his love and affection upon ſome one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſuch ſort as he meant to adopt him, and make him his heir, he would be careful that he ſhould be trained up according to his directions. Now faithful Parents muſt know and believe, that God is the God of them and their ſeed, and therefore having made his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, they ſhould earneſtly deſire to have the ſeal of it. I know that Baptiſm doth not confer grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as a Kings Letters under the broad-ſeal do not give a pardon to a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non profuit ei viſibilis Baptiſmus, quia defuit inviſibilis ſpiritus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> Auguſt.</note> but only ſignifie that it's the Kings pleaſure to afford him that favour; as alſo that all that are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, ſhall not be ſaved, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> The outward Baptiſm did not profit him, becauſe the inviſible holy Spirit was wanting to him. And laſtly, that it's not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, but God can ſave without it, as doubtleſs he did divers Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh children dying in the wilderneſs without circumciſion, and as was the caſe of the Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. However it be not neceſſary in regard
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170344:58"/>of God, yet in reſpect of us, it is, both that we may be obedient to his commandment, and alſo to help our weakneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They muſt be brought to Chriſt, and offered to God (when they have knowledge and years of diſcretion) by good education: for this God took ſpecial order in his Law; telling his people, that his laws muſt not only be in their own heads to know them,
<note place="margin">Deut. 6.7.</note> but in their mouths to talk of them, and learn them to their children. And queſtionleſs, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſſoluteneſs and diſobedience of children when they be grown up, proceeds from the careleſneſs of Parents; when they were young, they offered them not to Chriſt, nor put them to his ſchool, but trained them up in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, pride and vanity, which is the bane of youth. And thus ſome have brought their children to beggery, others to the Gallows, and more have brought them to ſpiritual and eternal death.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe heart is the principal ſeat of Pride: As the heart is in the midſt of the body to convay life to all parts; and as the Sun is in the midſt of the Firmament to convay his light, heat, and influences to all inferiour and ſublunary bodies; So Pride gets into the midſt of the heart to corrupt all: thence we read in Scripture of Pride of the heart,
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.</note> and of the proud in heart. This pride of heart is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,</p>
               <p>When the heart is carried out after great and high things; The Lord chargeth this on the Prince of <hi>Tyrus, thine heart is lifted up,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 28.2.</note> and thou haſt ſaid I am a God, I ſit in the ſeat of God, in the midſt of the ſeas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou ſet thy heart as the heart of God:</hi> By the heart we underſtand here, the thoughts, deſigns, projects, and high imaginations of the heart which carried out his heart after high and great things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is ſaid to <hi>ſcatter the proud in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their hearts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 1.51.</note>

               <p n="1">1. Hence it is that men lay aſide the ſtudy and the knowledge of practical truths, that tend moſt to edification, and would moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage them, and buſie themſelves about the knowledge of things too high for them, and which if they do know, they are not the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the power of godlineſs. <hi>Let no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile you of your reward</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians) in a voluntary humility and worſhipping of Angels,</hi>

<note place="margin">The word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

When men ſhall look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doctrines that tend to the practice of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as low things, and they muſt have higher things, this cometh from pride of heart. <hi>If any man conſent not to wholeſome words,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>Coſtui è gonfiato di ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia non ſapendo nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, ma eſſendo ſtolto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torno à le queſtioni.</hi> Ital.</note> even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions aad ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſings, perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing that gain is godlineſs:</hi> Such men as theſe may think themſelves the only Gnoſticks and knowing men, but ſuch a one is proud, knowing nothing; when men make uſe of their knowledge in a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170344:63"/>way of oppoſition, and ſo make themſelves and others Scepticks in religion, this is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ſcience falſly ſo called, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy truſt, avoiding prophane and vain bablings, and oppoſitions of ſcience falſly ſo called:</hi> this keeps men off the further from embracing the truth, and being ſetled in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From this root it is that many men ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry down Magiſtracy and Miniſtry; many ſuch there are in our daies: but theſe men do not act without a precedent,
<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Korah</hi> and his accomplices have ſhewed them the way. I know nothing that more croſſeth Satan in his deſign, then a good Magiſtracy and a faithful Miniſtry; and therefore 'tis no wonder, if by his inſtruments he labour firſt to corrupt them, then to diſparage them, and alienate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from them, and ſo to ruine them: and then they would ſet up themſelves in their places, who thus impudently cry down theſe two great Ordinances of Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Korah</hi> and his company aymed at the Prieſt-hood, appeareth by <hi>Moſes</hi> upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing to you, that the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from the congregation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to bring you near to himſelf to do the ſervice of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſeek ye the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood alſo?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, is it not enough that God hath advanced you above thouſands of your brethren, but that ye will
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170344:63"/>have the Prieſt-hood alſo? This was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Kohathites.</hi> What is <hi>Korahs</hi> plea? The people are all holy: what need then any one to teach or offer ſacrifice? they can all teach themſelves, ſay our Church levellers, the Church are all Saints, and they all know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt hath given <hi>ſome Apoſtles to his Church, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11, 12, 13, 14.</note> and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. where we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Paſtors and Teachers are as truly a gift to the Church of Chriſt, as Apoſtles and Prophets, though much inferiour to them, yet they are more conſtantly continued to the Church then the former.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe were given to the Church, not only by laying the ground-work to bring men home to Chriſt, but alſo to edifie the body of Chriſt, and to bring it to it's juſt perfection, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt: for till we come to be grown up in Chriſt, we have need of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a great means to prevent childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, which many nowadays are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, being toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine. Now from this pride of heart it is that men ſo much
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170344:64"/>ſlight the miniſtry; thoſe whoſe hearts are full of pride do lift up themſelves againſt Gods meſſengers; and the high conceit that men have of their own gifts and parts, makes them ſlight that miniſtry that God hath appointed for the ſalvation of their ſouls. Thus it was with the proud <hi>Corinthians:</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids by an <hi>Irony,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.8. <hi>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as Kings without us, and I would to God ye did reign, that we alſo might reign with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Now ye are full:</hi> full without us; ſo full, that they had no appetite to any more, no mind to any meat ſet before them, ſo fill'd were they with gifts and parts, that they had no mind to <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Now ye are rich:</hi> ſo rich, that they could impart to others, and even teach their teachers [rich without us].</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ye have reigned as Kings without us:</hi> as great difference between them as between King and Subjects;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Voi havete conſeguito il regno ſenza voi,</hi> ye have gotten a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without us. <hi>Hal.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1, 2.</note> proud men do ever carry a Kingdom in their heads; and then he ſpeaks by way of Emphaſis, now, or already: he could not ſpeak unto them as to men, but as to babes, that were fed with milk, not with meat, they were not paſt the ſpoon; yet were they ſo full, ſo rich, ſo high in their own conceit, that they needed not <hi>Pauls</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, nor any further teaching from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is evident that <hi>Korah</hi> &amp; his companions aimed not only at the Prieſt-hood, but alſo at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170344:64"/>the Scepter, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.13. for <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Moſes:</hi> Is it a ſmall thing that thou haſt brought us out of a land that ſloweth with milk and hony, to kill us in the wilderneſs, except thou make thy ſelf altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Prince over us? Wilt thou put out the eyes of theſe men? Now what was the fair vizard that they put upon ſo foul a face?</p>
               <p n="1">1. They pretend to be great enemies to ambition; they ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ye take too much upon you,
<note place="margin">This pretext would quickly take, when they made themſelves Tribunes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and chamoions for their ſpiritual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Torſhel.</hi>
                  </note> why lift you up your ſelves againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord? <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They cry up the people, they were an holy people, all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation are holy, every one of them; here then is the inference. No need of a Magiſtracy, they are a holy people that have the Lord to govern them; and a holy people that know how to govern themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They charge them for taking too much upon them, whereas they took no more then God had given them: and for lifting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above the congregation, when God had thus advanced them:
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.10, 11, 12.</note> yea <hi>Moſes</hi> was very backwards to take a commiſſion from God, and after he had it, complaineth of his burden, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.11. Now theſe men pretended to riſe up againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, that they were gathered together againſt the Lord:
<note place="margin">Numb. 16.11.</note> when God by his providence placeth men in the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170344:65"/>and they act faithfully in their places, thoſe that band againſt them do riſe up againſt the God of heaven, whoſe right it is to pull down one and ſet up another: therefore when ſuch as theſe are trampled upon, the Lord vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth his own authority, and exalteth his own name: See the ſucceſs of this courſe of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> &amp;c. it was very dreadful; for one part of them, the earth opened its mouth and ſwallowed them up and all that they had, ſo that they went down alive into the pit, and the earth cloſed upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. and another part of them were conſumed by fire from the Lord, even the two hundred and fifty men that preſumed to offer incenſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>The people therefore muſt not meddle with <hi>Davids</hi> Crown and Scepter, nor <hi>Samuels</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> muſt not meddle with the Ark, nor <hi>Saul</hi> offer ſacrifice: nor the Emperours Cook take upon him to expound Scripture; for if he do, and ſet a falſe gloſs upon it, and falſly apply it, <hi>Baſil</hi> may wiſely and worthily check and reprove him, It belongeth to thee to prepare puls and broth for the Emperour,

               <p n="1">1. When mans Will is ſet up againſt Gods Will. It is Gods prerogative Royal, that his Will is a Law to himſelf, and to all Creatures; it is his prerogative to do what ſeemeth good in his own eyes:
<note place="margin">I ſay unto you, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> that every proud man exalts himſelf above God; for God will have his Will to be done, and the proud man will have his own Will to be done. Now God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth things that are reaſonable; but the proud man goes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, and againſt reaſon. <hi>Bern. flor. cap.</hi> 1.</note> now here is the pride of man, that he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up his own Will to himſelf as his Law, and that he careth not to be guided and ruled by the Will and commands of God: every proud perſon ſeeks to do what ſeemeth good in his own eyes. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Jews, ſaying, obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people, and walk in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170344:66"/>all the waies that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you; but they hearkned not, nor enclined their ear, but walked in the counſels and imaginations of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.23, 24. and <hi>ver.</hi> 27. Therefore thou ſhalt ſpeak all theſe words unto them, but they will not hearken to thee, thou ſhalt alſo call unto them, but they will not anſwer thee. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when he confeſſeth that ſin of his in his youth, robbing his neighbours Ort-yards, he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth that ſin by many circumſtances, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, becauſe he would ſatisfie himſelf; and therefore ſaith, that all ſinners do what is good in their own eyes, not what God would have them.</p>
               <p>The Will of God revealed may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obedientia niſi humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſſe non poteſt.</hi> Auguſt.</note> The particular Will of God revealed to ſome particular perſons, upon particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to the performance of ſome particular duties; and this many times diſpenceth with a general precept: as we may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. when <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to go to mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> and there offer up his own ſon in ſacrifice to the Lord, contrary to the ſixth commandment, that ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Non occides,</hi> thou ſhalt not kill. <hi>Item,</hi> Exod. 11.2. Exod. 3.22. where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are commanded to rob and ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to the eighth commandment, which ſaith, <hi>non furaberis,</hi> thou ſhalt not ſteal.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170344:66"/>So where <hi>Saul</hi> is commanded to ſlay the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites,</hi> with all that appertained to them,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.3.</note> and ſpare nothing. Now herein appeared <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> humility in ſetting about what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and <hi>Sauls</hi> pride,
<note place="margin">Proud men wiſh in their hearts, though they dare not ſpeak it with their tongues, for <hi>fiat voluntas tua, fiat voluntas mea;</hi> the wicked through the pride of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4.</note> in doing no more of Gods command then what ſeemed good to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is reproved by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and rejected, by the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.28. But theſe inſtances are no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents to us, unleſs we have the like charge that they had, and then we muſt yeild abſolute and ſimple obedience, without reaſoning or diſputing the caſe: For however Gods Will be ſometimes <hi>occulta,</hi> yet it is never <hi>injuſta,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin:</hi> he doth not as men ſhould do, <hi>viz.</hi> bid things becauſe they be lawful, and forbid them becauſe unlawful; but whatſoever they were before, his Will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the nature of them; for whatſoever he biddeth is lawful;
<note place="margin">Ipſo facto, virtute mandati aut intera dicti.</note> and whatſoever he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth is unlawful, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by vertue of the command or interdiction; of this we have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any examples nowadaies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other branch of his revealed Will which is more ordinary, is his general Will concerning all eſtates and conditions of people, contained in his general precepts: and this hath divers branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt whereof is the converſion of a ſinner. As I live ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170344:67"/>the wicked turn from his way and live. And Chriſt ſaith, This is the Will of him that ſent me,
<note place="margin">John 6.40.</note> that every one that ſeeth the Son and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould have everlaſting life. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that it is the Will of God, that ſome of all ſorts of people ſhould be ſaved,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4.</note> and come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond branch of Gods revealed Will to us, is our Sanctification, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that it is the Will of God, that by well-doing we put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.15</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now when men do not endeavour to effect their own converſion, when they will not come to Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.40.</note> that they may have life, nor labour after ſanctification, they ſet their wills againſt the Will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond note of Will-pride is impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When men are impatient of reproof: better is the patient in ſpirit than the proud in ſpirit, ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.8. <hi>Superbi amant verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem lucentem, oderunt redarguentem.</hi> Aug. confeſ. lib. 10. cap 23.</note> Reverend <hi>Muſculus</hi> found this ſpirit in the Anabaptiſts in his time; when he had deſerted the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, he was compelled through poverty, to hire himſelf with a Taylor, and to work with him at his trade; this man he found to be an Anabaptiſt, one that pretended to much holineſs, but was nothing ſo, though a great talker. <hi>Muſculus</hi> therefore repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him; and among other things finding that he was idle, and neglected his calling,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170344:67"/>urged him, with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that will not work, let him not eat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Melch. Adam. in vit. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. p.</hi> 735.</note> But the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt was too proud to receive a reproof, and poor <hi>Muſculus</hi> was preſently thruſt out of his doors. Pride ſtops the ear againſt reproof. <hi>Reprove a ſcorner, ſaith</hi> Solomon, <hi>and he will hate thee:</hi> this ſhews ſuch men to have Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical hearts; did they believe holy reproofs and threatnings taken out of the Word of God, they would not ſcorn them, but tremble at them: when the Word of God cometh ſo cloſe, that it toucheth mens boſome ſins, and croſſeth them in their evil ways, but they will not hearken, but find out ſhifts to evade the force of the Word, this cometh from Pride in the Wills of men. When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had made an end of ſpeaking to all the people all the Words of the Lord, for which the Lord their God had ſent him to them:
<note place="margin">Jerem. 43.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Then ſpake</hi> Azariah <hi>the ſon of</hi> Hoſhajah, <hi>and</hi> Johanan <hi>the ſon of</hi> Kareah, <hi>and all the proud men, ſaying to</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſly; The Lord God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Go not into Egypt to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ there; but</hi> Baruch <hi>the ſon of</hi> Neriah, <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee on againſt us.</hi> Now as a proud man hateth a juſt reproof, ſo being guilty, he eaſily applyeth to himſelf any thing that he heareth, though not ſpoken to him,
<note place="margin">Sueton. <hi>in vit.</hi> Tiber. Neron.</note> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth of <hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi> that hearing <hi>Zeno</hi> the Philoſopher diſputing, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome harſh ſentences he uſed, he asked in what Dialect he ſpake? who anſwering truly, in the <hi>Dorick,</hi> it was taken ſo ill, as the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170344:68"/>poor man was condemned to perpetual baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, as if he had cloſly taxed <hi>Tiberius</hi> his looſe and laſcivious life he led among the <hi>Rhodians</hi> who ſpake that Dialect. They who have high thoughts of themſelves, think meanly of what others ſay to them: were men poor in ſpirit, they would embrace every advice that hath truth and holineſs in it. Therefore when the Prophet would faſten a reproof on the Jews,
<note place="margin">Jerem. 13.15.</note> he ſaith to them, <hi>Hear, and give ear, and be not proud.</hi> As in the matter of private reproofs, ſo, the proud man cannot endure Church cenſures.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deb. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquila</hi> the antient Greek tranſlator of the Bible, left Chriſtianity, and turned to Judaiſm, being angry at a ſentence of excommunication againſt him: ſo <hi>Santan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus</hi> the great Lawyer of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> was much enraged againſt the famous <hi>Camero,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cameron. Stellit. <hi>in Epiſt.</hi>
                  </note> and other Miniſters of the Proteſtant Church, becauſe he was convented before their Synod for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When men are impatient under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: A proud man cannot endure to be croſt in any thing, nor bear the leaſt affront: ſuch men are like the Devil, who is the proudeſt and the moſt diſcontented creature of all other: Pride fils men with murmuring &amp; diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt Gods Providences; if things go not according to a proud mans will, then he fumeth and is impatient. Thus it was with the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites;</hi> God had brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> brought them through the wilderneſs, and to the border of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170344:68"/>they hear there are Giants, and fenced Cities,
<note place="margin">Num. 14.2, 3, 4.</note> then they fall a murmuring againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſaid unto them: <hi>would God that we had dyed in the land of Egypt, or in this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:</hi> and in their mad mood, they ſay one to another, <hi>Let us make a Captain, and let us return into</hi> Egypt. So in like manner thoſe diſcontented rebels, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. call <hi>Egypt</hi> a land flowing with milk and hony, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. whereas it was a land where their infants were murdered, and themſelves cruelly enſlaved; they had forgotten thoſe evils and miſeries out of which God had delivered them, but now they talk as if God and <hi>Moſes</hi> had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them, but deprived them of many comforts which there they poſſeſſed. <hi>He that ruleth over his own ſpirit,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Latius regnes domando ſpiritum, quam ſi Lybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am remotis Gadibus jungas.</hi> Horat. lib. 2. od. 2. ad Saluſt.</note> 
                  <hi>is greater than he that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh Cities,</hi> Prov. 16.32. Therefore ſelf-denyal is a Grace enjoyned by our Saviour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the bearing of the Croſs, <hi>Luk:</hi> 9.23. A man muſt not only <hi>abnegare ſua,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and forſake his goods and lands for Chriſts ſake, if neceſſity require; nor alſo <hi>abnegare ſuos,</hi> forſake his friends if they labour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from his beſt friend;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amandus eſt genitor, ſed praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amdus eſt Creator.</hi> Arabr.</note> but alſo <hi>abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gareſe,</hi> he muſt deny himſelf, yea to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as it were an excommunicate perſon (as one ſaith in another caſe) if he will bring his will to ſubmit to Gods Will, and quietly bear the yoke of Chriſt. How patiently doth our Saviour carry himſelf in this reſpect; when a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170344:69"/>bitter cup was put into his hand to drink. Thus he praies to his Father: <hi>Father, if thou be willing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.42 Matth. 26.39.</note> 
                  <hi>remove this cup from me,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it: <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it: nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, theſe latter words be a correction of his former petition,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Videmus ut pia ſint vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, quae in ſpeciem à dei voluntate diſcrepant: quia non exactè ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, vel ſcrupuloſe à nobis inquiri vult deus, quid ſtatuerit ipſe, ſed quod pro ſenſus noſtri captu optabile eſt, flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari à ſe permittit.</hi> Calv. in Harm.

Its lawful ſaith he, to pray for the peaceable and flouriſhing eſtate of the Church, the ſuppreſſing of ſuperſtition, and the repreſſing of the enemies of Gods truth, though perhaps he purpoſe not to grant theſe things, but will have his Son reign in the midſt of his enemies, and his Church as the Lilly among thorns, and the wicked to remain, to exerciſe the faith and patience of his Saints.</p>
               <p>But in my conceit <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith better on <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>The meaning then briefly, may be this: Father, if it may ſtand with thy good pleaſure,
<note place="margin">Chriſt was willing to die, <hi>voluntate rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> though not <hi>naturali,</hi> for our redemption, to be obedient to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Lumb. ſent. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>diſtin.</hi> 17.</note> and mans redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may otherwiſe be wrought, let this bitter potion of my paſſion paſs by me; but rather then diſobey thy decree, and not do what I came for, I yeeld to any thing, ſubmitting my ſelf to thee, and my will to thine.</p>
               <p>This confutes the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> a Sect of Hereticks of old, that thought and taught Chriſt to have but one pure Will, as <hi>Calvin</hi> noteth: but properly it condemneth ſuch as deſire the fulfilling of their own perverſe, crooked and corrupt wills, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of the Will of God: but if Chriſt in whom reaſon never loſt his regiment,

               <head>CHAP. 16. <hi>Of Pride in the affections.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PRide in the affections is diſcovered by a kind of a ſinful and fantaſtical affectation to be like unto God: there is a likeneſs to God in holineſs, in grace, in humility, this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; and this is the Image of God wherein man was created; but Pride is a ſinful affecting to be like unto God. There are two things wherein a proud perſon doth affect to be like unto God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is Gods prerogative royal, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever excellency he hath, he hath them in and of himſelf; he is not beholden to any creature,
<note place="margin">It is written of one <hi>Timotheus</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> that after he had proudly ſaid in a great aſſembly, <hi>Haec ego feci, non fortuna,</hi> he never after proſpered in any thing. Deut. 8.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> and the whole glory of all that he hath belongeth to him: Now a proud man doth aſſume to himſelf the glory of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that he hath. Therefore God gives a caveat to his people, <hi>Beware when thy herds and flocks multiply, and thy ſilver and thy gold is multiplied,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that then thy heart be not lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170344:70"/>which brought thee forth out of the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, from the houſe of bondage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Beware leſt thou ſay in thy heart, My power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me all this wealth: But thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. ſaith he, when thou ſhalt paſs over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and poſſeſs Nations greater and mightier than thy ſelf, Cities great and fenced up to heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>speak not thou in thine heart,</hi> after that the Lord thy God hath caſt them out from before thee, <hi>ſaying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 9.1, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For my righteouſneſs the Lord hath brought me in to poſſeſs this land; but for the wickedneſs of theſe Nations the Lord doth drive them out before thee:</hi> Perhaps in word, the proud man may make ſome kind of acknowledgement of God, as the proud Phariſee; Lord, I thank thee, I am not as other men are, nor even as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can: yet he aſſumeth all the glory to himſelf, though in word he ſeem to honour God.
<note place="margin">Pariſienſis</note> 
                  <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſaith, that a proud man is both an <hi>idolater,</hi> and ſets up himſelf as his <hi>own idol,</hi> and ſo robs God of his glory. The proud man makes himſelf his own <hi>Alpha,</hi> thanks himſelf for all; makes himſelf his own <hi>Omega,</hi> ſeeks himſelf in all, begins, and ends at himſelf. Humble <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>In me, that is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>in my fleſh, there dwells no good thing,</hi> and when he ſpeaks of his own labours, <hi>he ſaith,</hi>

                  <hi>by the Grace of God I am that I am.</hi> The Papiſts here are to be taxed, who (as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> do confeſs) affirm Gods election to be becauſe of faith or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170344:71"/>good works foreſeen in us. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture and reaſon: for that which is the effect, cannot be the cauſe; but good works and faith be the fruits of election; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks thus on <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.

It was the errour of the Elders of the Jews, when they came to Chriſt in the behalf of the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> to plead his worthineſs to him, why he ſhould heal his ſervant. Here was their Pride to think, that by outward ſervice of God men might merit his favour: <hi>He loveth our Nation</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and hath built us a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 7.2, 3, 4.</note> wherein they reſemble our <hi>Papiſts</hi> and divers orders of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> who will not ſtick to promiſe men heaven, if they will be but bountiful Benefactors to their Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Monaſteries, Cells and Cloyſters: But however he could challenge nothing for himſelf,

                     <hi>Omnes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egrini ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae religiones, Senatus conſulto damnatae erant.</hi> Tertul. in apologet. cont. gentes.</note> nor they for him at Gods hand, for theſe his good deeds; yet he was a worthy man,

Now the deſign of the Devil is to make a man proud of his gifts, and to look more upon his gifts, then look to the giver of them: when a man feeds this humour in himſelf, and is ſo far from checking it in his heart, that he rather ſeeks to foment it, and add matter to it, and ſheweth it by the contempt of others of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour gifts, this is a note that gifts do puffe him up with Pride.</p>

               <p>Now this is a great vanity for a man to be proud of gifts.</p>

                  </note> but is the gift of God, and cometh from the grace of God. Thus one ſaith, All my evils are purely evil, and mine; All my good things are purely good, and not mine: And <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon the fifth Petition of the Lords prayer ſaith, What can be leſs then bread? yet leſt we might think to have that of our ſelves, our Maſter hath taught us to beg it of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, ſaying, and praying daily, Give us this day our daily bread: therefore ſeeing all that we have, whither for the body or mind, are Gods gifts, we muſt not ſay of them as proud <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> doth, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>that I have built?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. Be not theſe the things that I have attained to by my wit, parts, induſtry? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may not ſay of the gifts of God in us, as the Atheiſts of their tongues, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. that they are our own, and we may do with them what we liſt: for, if they are ours, let us ſhew our evidence,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170344:74"/>when we purchaſed them, and what we paid for them, before whom the inſtruments were drawn, ſealed and delivered: Beſides, we muſt know that as our gifts be not our own abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fee-ſimple and free-hold, but we only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holders and tenants at will, nor have we any ſuch cuſtome but may be broken at the pleaſure of our Land-lord: ſo we be not ſo much as quarter owners of them, but only ſtewards over them, and muſt be accomptable for them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.2.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Pride of gifts hinders a man from doing much good with them; the end why God giveth diverſities of gifts to men, is that they may impart them to the benefit of one another:
<note place="margin">

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170344:74"/>impart their gifts to the good of one another.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.21, 22, 25.</note> As in the body natural there are many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet but one body, and the eye cannot ſay to the hand, nor the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, but all muſt be helpful to, and not diſdain each other, that there may be no ſchiſme in the body, the members muſt have the ſame care of one another: ſo men of the greateſt gifts and parts muſt not diſdain to be helpful to the meaneſt Chriſtian.

About theſe things many men beat their wits: But its better to have a true knowledge of a mans ſelf, then the courſe, ſcituation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the ſtars and planets, then the vertues of herbs and plants, then the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of humours, and complexions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, then the natures of beaſts or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Philoſophy rational, moral or natural can afford to man; for what booteth it the <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritian</hi> or <hi>Coſmographer</hi> to be able to meaſure the compaſs of the earth, or take the height of the moon, when with all his art he cannot meet out the length of his own life, though but a ſpan long, nor take the meaſure of himſelf and his own deceitful heart? if we look not into our ſelves, we cannot know our ſelves; and if we take a ſtrict view of our ſelves, we cannot be proud.

(Which of you having a ſervant ploughing or feeding of cattel, will ſay unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and ſit down to meat, and will not rather ſay unto him, Make ready wherewith I may ſup, and gird thy ſelf and ſerve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou ſhalt eat and drink? doth he thank that ſervant, becauſe he did the things that were commanded him?

<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.15.</note> and are even dead to ſenſe, God will revive the ſpirit of the humble; pride and vain-glory are ſpiritual ſpiders; if they enter into our hearts, and we do not hunt them out again, as the Bees do the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpiders out of their hives, we ſhall ſoon ſee the ſtore-houſe of our conſcience to be much troubled and perplexed.

               <p n="2">2. Conſider that every man in the world is born a poor, naked, helpleſs creature, and born to labour and trouble. Naked came I out of my mothers womb,
<note place="margin">Job 1.21.</note> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> and this one thought well taken in, and fully digeſted, will lay pride in the duſt; And here I might ſhew you how nature, which ſhews her ſelf a mother to other creatures, is but as it were a ſtep-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto man, denying him many of thoſe natural helps wherewith they are endowed,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui natus non eſt in dolore, putet ſe natum non eſſe ad laborem; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor eſt in Actione, Dolor eſt in paſſione; &amp; quid non eis grave, quibus vivere labor eſt?</hi> Bern.</note> for this is the common condition of all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity: In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.

               <p n="3">3. The conſideration of the manifold pains, weakneſſes, ſickneſſes, and infirmities of the body, ſhould much abate our pride. God takes away health and ſtrength many times from his deareſt children, as from <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20.1. from <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 41.8. and from <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom Jeſus loved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.3. God many times brings diſeaſes upon our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cure the diſeaſe of pride.
<note place="margin">Gregor. praefat. in Moral.</note> 
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, that while he was expounding the tragical hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> that he was afflicted with continual feavers; yet this good he thereby gathered, that it ſo fell out, that by Gods Providence, himſelf being ſick and wounded, ſhould expound wounded <hi>Job;</hi> theſe ſtrokes upon his body made him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to underſtand, and with words the better to expreſs the mind of wounded <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God opens the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction: he is chaſtened alſo with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain; and the end that God aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at is, that he may withdraw man from his purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Job 33.16, 17, 19, 20.</note> and hide pride from man: bodily weakneſſes many times bring down the pride and ſtoutneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The frequent and ſerious conſideration of death, to which the body is alſo ſubject, is of great force to pull down pride, and keep the ſpirit very humble. Death is the humble mans univerſity; no man would be proud of bodily ſtrength or beauty, did he frequently think of death; this would make the ſtouteſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170344:119"/>to ſtrike ſail, and caſt down their proud creſts in the midſt of their greateſt jollity. O thou who art duſt and aſhes, why doſt thou wax proud? remember whence thou art and be aſhamed, where thou art and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whither thou art going,

                  </note> and tremble for fear, ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> Let us conſtantly remember our end, and we ſhall not do amiſs. Let the meditation of the death of the body be to us, as <hi>Philips Page,</hi> as <hi>Joſephs Sepulchre</hi> in his garden, a place of pleaſure. <hi>Facile contemnit omnia, qui aſſidue cogitat ſe moriturum;</hi> that man eaſily deſpiſeth all things, who daily thinketh that he ſhall die.

               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider the ſtate and condition of our ſouls, and hence we may fetch matter enough to keep down our pride. Man was made an excellent creature, made in the image of God, in knowledge, righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but this image of God in man is by his fall much weakened, and he that was by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nobleſt creature on earth, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a vagabond on earth, a child of wrath,

               <p n="1">1. Conſider the greatneſs of God, and the ſuperiority of God above man, and the power that he hath over man:
<note place="margin">Pſ. 95.3, 6.</note> the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us worſhip and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker, ſaith the Pſalmiſt: If man <hi>could do according to his will,</hi> and God <hi>would do according to his power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.6, 7</note> who could ſtand? I will deſtroy man from the face of the earth, ſaith the Lord: The Original word is, as <hi>Pareus</hi> hath it,
<note place="margin">Pareus <hi>in loc.</hi>
                  </note> I will <hi>ſteep him</hi> as a man ſteeps a piece of earth in water, till it turn to dirt, for man is but clay, and forgets his Maker, and his matter; none but God can reduce man to his firſt principles, and original matter whereof he was made; there is no duſt ſo high, but this great God is able to give it a ſteeping; God is alwaies provided of a rod for his children, and of an ax and ſword for his enemies; though
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170344:121"/>he doth not alwaies ſmite, yet he is ever ready;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.13.</note> he hath prepared inſtruments of death; his bow is bent and his arrows are upon the ſtring; therefore when thou walkeſt in the ruffe of thy pride, God can ſtretch out his Almighty arm, and let fly a deadly arrow that may wound thy ſoul for ever. Therefore when thou beginneſt at any time to be pufft up, think who thou art, and who God is; when thou thinkeſt thou art ſomething, look upon the greatneſs of the moſt high God, and then thou wilt ſee thou art juſt nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the holineſs of God, and then look upon thine own ſinfulneſs and vileneſs, and thou wilt ſee little cauſe to be proud. <hi>Biſhop Hooper</hi> ſaid at the ſtake, Lord, thou art heaven, I am hell; Thou art Juſtice, I am ſin, was <hi>Luther</hi> alſo wont to ſay. Gods holineſs will ſhew us our ſinful ſpots and defilements. When the Prophet ſaw a glorious viſion of the Lord,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.3, 5.</note> and heard the Seraphims proclaim the thrice holy name of God, he cries out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips. How ſhall I that am altogether unclean ſtand before this holy Lord God? The pride of man muſt needs fall down before the holineſs of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the goodneſs of God; and that will abate our pride. When <hi>David</hi> ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Abigail,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.41.</note> to aſſure her he would be her husband, this maketh <hi>Abigail</hi> low in our own eyes: Let me, ſaith ſhe, be a ſervant to waſh the feet of the ſervants of my Lord;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170344:122"/>ſhall <hi>David</hi> honour me to make me his wife, who am ſcarce worthy to be one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? So the conſideration of Gods great goodneſs to man, is a ſpecial means to humble him before the Lord. What am I, O Lord, that thou ſhouldſt ſet thy heart upon me, Create me after thine Image, Redeem me by the blood of thy Son, provide Heaven and Glory for me? the conſideration of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will make him have low thoughts of himſelf, and not quarrel with God, when God beſtows great mercies upon others. This was <hi>Jonahs</hi> fault: God had delivered him and his companions in the ſhip, from the fury of two mercileſs elements, <hi>viz.</hi> the air and waters, both which ſeemed to have conſpired their deſtruction, but are reſtrained by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power of God; the Lord apprehends <hi>Jonah,</hi> arreſts him, and ſafely delivereth him into his priſon; yet he is ſo far from being cruſhed or torn in pieces by the devouring jaws of that cruel monſter, as he's not once touched by his teeth; and he is ſafely kept there forth-coming amidſt many dangers in that dark dungeon, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt from being choked by the noiſome vapours of the fiſhes entrals: Secondly, from being digeſted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and turned to his nouriſhment by the continual boiling heat of his ſtomack; and laſtly, he is not caſt out into the ſea to ſhift for himſelf, and ſink or ſwim as we ſay, but he is ſafely landed and ſet on ſhore; and not only is he delivered, but a whole City conſiſting of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170344:122"/>millions of people (by his Sermon brought to repentance,) delivered from ſome ſtrange vengeance which otherwiſe had ſeized upon them:
<note place="margin">Jon. 4.1.</note> but <hi>Jonah</hi> was very much diſpleaſed at it, and falls to expoſtulating the buſineſs with God himſelf: and though God dealeth with him <hi>Socratice,</hi> and ſpurs him a queſtion, ſaying, Doſt thou well to be angry? to which queſtion he's not able to make any reaſonable anſwer: yet <hi>Jonahs</hi> heart ſwells againſt God for ſparing <hi>Niniveh.</hi> Pride, ſelf-love, and ambition, and ſtanding too much upon his reputation made him thus to do; and rather then he would be diſcredited and thought a falſe Prophet, he would have <hi>Niniveh</hi> deſtroyed,

               <p>This is the command of the Lord Jeſus, and the badge and livery whereby we may be known to the world to be the Diſciples of him who is the moſt admirable pattern of humility and lowlineſs.</p>
               <p>Divers reaſons why we ſhould love one another as our ſelves, may be taken from the ſimilitude of the members of the natural body, where the Apoſtle tells us, that as the body being but one,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> hath many members, ſo we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, are all members of the ſame myſtical body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more noble and honourable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deſpiſe not the leſs honourable, and thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170344:123"/>that are appointed to more baſe offices: as for inſtance, the head, though it ſelf be covered, and carried aloft, doth not contemn the feet, though they travel and trudge to carry the whole body about: no more ought the rich in gifts, parts or eſtate, deſpiſe the poor;
<note place="margin">Mal. 2.10.</note> for they be their fellow members, made of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the ſame Maker. The rich Angels in heaven deſpiſe not the poor Saints on earth, but are ready to perform the duties of love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as appeareth by their carrying the ſoul of the poor beggar into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom;
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.22</note> and ſo ought it to be on earth, as <hi>James</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<note place="margin">Jac. 2.1, 2.</note> not having the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the more noble contemn not the leſs noble, no more do the leſs noble envy the more noble; and ſo it ſhould be among us; for as the hands and the feet grudge not that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are uſed and employed as inſtruments to feed and defend the head and heart, no more muſt ſubjects and ſervants, and men of meaner condition envy their ſuperiors, and Maſters the places that God hath allotted them, but content themſelves with their own, and be faithful and painful in them, as King <hi>David</hi> willed <hi>Ziba</hi> and his ſons and ſervants to do for his Maſters ſon <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> 2 Sam. 9.10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If one member fail in performance of ſome duty, whereby another catcheth hurt, the other doth not in a rage run upon it and hurt it again; as for example; if the foot
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170344:124"/>chance to ſlip, and ſo the head catch a knock, it doth not preſently perſwade the hand to heat the foot; or if the teeth bite the tongue, this were to ſeek the ruine and deſtruction of the whole body: no more ought we in our mad mood furiouſly to ruſh one upon another, when we have been unawares hurt one by another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When one member is hurt, the whole body feels it, and fares the worſe for it; as for example; a thorn in the foot grieveth the head, yea the very heart; ſo ought we to have a ſympathy and fellow-feeling of the hurt of one another, as Chriſt our head hath of us all, as is evident by that ſpeech he uſeth to <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> why perſecuteſt thou me? <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. ſignifying to us that the hurt that was done to his members on earth, even reached him their head in heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What good parts ſoever any of the members be endued with, they hoard not up, nor reſerve to themſelves as Monopolies, but impart and employ them for the good and benefit of the whole body, and the meaneſt member thereof; if a toe or a finger be but fore, the eye looketh, the head deviſeth how to help it, and if they be not able to do it themſelves by their own skill, then they ſeek out to others, and the tongue will play the Orator, and entreat, yea rather then fail, and not have it, the hand will play the Almoner and reward; thus ſhould we be willing to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170344:124"/>afford our mutual help one to another, and ſo we would if we were once perſwaded of the neceſſity of this duty, that we ought to love our neighbour as our ſelf; but pride and ſelf-love do ſo blind the eyes of men, that they will not learn this leſſon;

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170344:128"/>himſelf of his own glory, and appear only in our infirmity; for he did not caſt away the nature of God, when he took upon him the nature of man; <hi>ſed manſit quoderat, &amp; tamen aſſumpſit quod non erat;</hi>

Now the great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God manifeſt in the fleſh will appear, if we conſider his birth, his life and his death. There are many circumſtances in his birth to ſet forth his humility to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In making choice of a poor and humble mother; one that was of a mean and low eſtate, as ſhe her ſelf confeſſeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.48. Her mean eſtate appeareth in divers things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In her marriage with <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Carpenter, an handy-crafts man, a man of a low and mean calling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their travelling without a hand-maid, or any ſervant to attend them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By her offering at her purification: ſhe offereth not a lamb for a burnt-offering, and a turtle dove for a ſin-offering,
<note place="margin">Luk. 2.24.</note> as was required of the wealthier ſort, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.6. but two Turtles only, or a pair of Pigeons, which was indifferent by the law.
<note place="margin">Maldonat.</note> Yea <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Jeſuits conceit is, that they were only a pair of young Pigeons, as being of leſs pains to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170344:129"/>find, and leſs price to pay for; whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the poverty of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi> for however <hi>Chemnitius</hi> conceiteth,
<note place="margin">Chemnit.</note> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the typical Lamb was not offered, becauſe the true Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world was preſent.
<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. yet <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and all other Proteſtant writers that I have ſeen, do make their poverty the reaſon thereof. Therefore the Popiſh painters are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſetting out <hi>Mary</hi> ſtill in rich attire, like a Lady of great ſtate and pomp, thus feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peoples ears with fables, and their eyes with bables.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the time of his birth. 1. He was born in the winter,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cujus in arbitrio tempus erat, naſciturus tempus ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git moleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Aretius.</note> the ſharpeſt ſeaſon of the year.

               <p n="2">2. He was born in a time when the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Jews put under tribute by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> ſent a decree that all the world ſhould be taxed, <hi>i e.</hi> all the Countries and Provinces within his dominions, <hi>viz.</hi> the inhabitants of all their Cities and Villages ſhould aſſemble themſelves to their head City, and there have their names taken,
<note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> that according to their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170344:129"/>eſtates, a tax might be ſet upon them, to be yearly paid to his treaſury and coffers; and herein alſo appeared his humility in being born under the tyranny of <hi>Octavianus.</hi> Conſider the place of his birth, it was not at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the principal City of the land,
<note place="margin">Mic. 5.2.</note> but at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem</hi> a little City of <hi>David:</hi> the bread of life will be born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>the houſe of bread,</hi> a place little among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Judah,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Michah</hi> term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. But he might have been born at ſome Aldermans houſe in this poor City, and have had the beſt reſpect it could afford; no ſuch matter; they muſt buy their welcome, and lodge in an Inn; Well! there they might be well reſpected for their money, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient lodging — It will not be had; they either came too late, or elſe carry not that port as they may think to gain enough by them; their chambers are either taken up, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſerved for better gueſts; he was born in an Inn to ſhew himſelf a ſtranger on earth, and that we ought ſtill ſo to behave our ſelves,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11.</note> as ſtrangers and Pilgrims upon earth. But in what room of this Inn? even in a ſtable; the other rooms are otherwiſe appointed; and in that ſtable both the Aſſes provender,
<note place="margin">He that was the bread of life, is laid in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as the food of beaſts,</note> and the ſpotleſs body of this Lamb of God, were alike entertained in a manger. Men by ſin had made themſelves unfit for the ſociety of Angels, and became like the beaſts that periſh; therefore he ſeeks us among beaſts; this was a ſign given by the Angel to the Shepherds; Ye ſhall find
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170344:130"/>the child ſwadled and laid in a manger, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.12. This ſufficiently confuteth all legends, that talk of his being born in a cave not far from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where they ſay, many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles appeared to <hi>Joſeph:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chemmit. harmon. part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 274.</note> but theſe are but falſe and fabulous; howbeit they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and too much credited by too many of the Antients, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſheweth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth circumſtance of his humility at his birth, was the divulging of his birth, to a few baſe and mean Shepherds: and here we may ſee a manifeſt difference between the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the wiſdom of the world; for whom do the great men in the world joyn in friendſhip to them, and make of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and employ in their affairs? Surely no Shepherds, and Neate-herds, and husbandmen, whom their rude education and mean breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterly debarreth of all ſuch favours: to whom do great men ſend their Embaſſadours with news of ſtate? not to mean men, but to their neighbour Princes; peradventure Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen at plough, and Shepherds in the field may ſee a poſt as he paſſeth to the Court before the King himſelf, but not any Nobleman ſhall be made privy to his buſineſs, till he come to the King to whom he is ſent; and the news ſhall be ſtale, before it come to the ears of the vulgar and common people: But Chriſt takes not this courſe; he doth not ſend his Angel immediately to the Emperours Court, nor to <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilat,</hi> and the Phariſees, and Scribes, or any of the chief eſtates of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170344:130"/>that ſo they reporting it again might have added the greater credit to it; this in worldly wiſdom ſhould have ſeemed a courſe moſt convenient, but Gods waies are not ours: the Angel was ſent to theſe ragged meſſengers, to declare the birth of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> unto, rather then to the great ones of the world, to ſhew the humility of him that was ſent to ſave the world, and therein to be an example of humility to us.</p>

<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Jer.

Chriſt out of his great humility, took this mean calling upon him, to leave us an example in this kind, to ſhun idleneſs, and to live in ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calling; <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were of the blood Royal, and nobly born; yet things being as they were with them, they held it no ſhame to bring up their ſon to a mechanical trade: the old Patriarchs notwithſtanding they were petty Kings, yet brought they up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren either in keeping Cattle, or tilling the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170344:131"/>ground: <hi>Solon</hi> made a law, that that Father could challenge no reverence or duty from his ſon, that had not brought him up in ſome calling, whereby he might live and maintain himſelf; and among the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> the faſhion was that every year every man ſhould appear before the Governours, and ſhew by what means he got his living, and all idle perſons were baniſht: and among the <hi>Maſſalians,</hi> they would admit none into their Cities, but ſuch as had trades to live by, and maintain themſelves. What ſhame can it be for any man to be skilful in ſome Art? Art is no burden,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſervant to God. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. He came to do ſuch a piece of ſervice, as all the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth were never able to have performed; the greateſt work muſt be done by the greateſt ſervant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To man alſo he was a ſervant: for our ſakes it was that he made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: It had been much for him to have taken upon him the form of a King; conſidering what an eſtate he left for it, it had been an uneven exchange; but he doth much more; of Lord of all, he becomes a ſervant to all: as he came into the world without pomp, ſo he carrieth himſelf in the world without pride. The whole life of Chriſt was nothing but a ſervice to others; therefore he ſaith to his Diſciples, when ſome of them affected a preheminence above the reſt;
<note place="margin">Mat 20.28</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant, even as the ſon of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170344:132"/>&amp;c.</hi> None ſent for Chriſt but he came unto them; none had any need of him but he attended them; he viſited the ſick, toucht un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean leapers, and ſerved his Diſciples, even to the waſhing of their feet,
<note place="margin">Joh. 13.5.</note> yea ſuch was his humility, that he waſheth the feet of him that betraied him: he was a great ſervant to us; he did our work and ſuffered our puniſhment. Upon the conſideration of this great example of humility, <hi>Guericus</hi> a holy man cries out,
<note place="margin">Viciſti Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ſuperbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am means.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt overcome, O Lord, thou haſt overcome my Pride;</hi> this example hath maſtered me; I deliver my ſelf up into thy hands, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive liberty or exaltation, but in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy humbleſt ſervant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His humility appeared further in making choice of an humble ſociety and company of attendants; what were his Diſciples but a company of poor fiſhermen? he makes no choice of great Kings, or wiſe Senators, or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orators to blazen his glory, or to be the trumpeters of his fame, but poor fiſhermen, men of a mean calling, and of low eſteem in the world: the men that he converſed with were poor Publicans and the inferior ſort of people, preaching much oftner in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of little villages, then in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and it was one part of the anſwer that he willed <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Diſciples return to their Maſter,
<note place="margin">Luk. 7.22.</note> that the poor had the Goſpel preached unto them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His poverty alſo ſhews his great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though he were the Lord of glory, and the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170344:133"/>King of heaven, yet he laid aſide his glory; though he were rich, yet he became poor, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. when he was come to his own finding as it were, and had a family to look unto, <hi>viz.</hi> his twelve Apoſtles, he had not an houſe to put his head into: The Foxes ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Luk. 9.58.</note> have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the ſon of man hath not where to lay his head:
<note place="margin">Luke 8.3.</note> he lived much upon the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of many which miniſtred unto him of their ſubſtance: he had not an horſe of his own to ride upon, and therefore we read that in his travels he either went on foot, or was very meanly mounted, <hi>viz.</hi> upon an Aſs, and that but borrowed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. according to the Prophecy, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9. nay he had not at all times money to pay ſcot and lot; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> muſt go fiſh for money, before they can pay their tribute: nor hath he a houſe of his own to eat the Paſſeover in with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Marke</hi> 12. nor money in his own purſe to provide it at his own coſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 17.27 <hi>Pauperta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitias nòn amiſit, ſed tantum ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondit. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dives erat, for is tantum pauper, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Deus in divitiis, patens homo in paupertate, &amp; ſimul in uno Deus &amp; Homo, dives &amp; pauper.</hi> Gorran.</note> but muſt borrow and be beholden to others: nor a Tombe of his own to be buried in, but is fain to be laid in <hi>Joſephs</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> Matth. 27. Now he became thus poor to ſanctifie poverty to us, and make it the more tolerable by his bearing of it. When Souldiers ſee their Captains par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with them in their labours and travels, and to ſuffer hunger, and cold, and thirſt alike
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170344:133"/>with them, it works much upon them, and is a ſtrong argument to perſwade them to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humility. I have read of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, that in his travels, he came to ſuch huge mountains of ſnow, as none of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany durſt adventure over, which when he ſaw, he alighted from his horſe, and went over the tops of them, which his company eſpying, ſome for love, and ſome for ſhame, all follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. What encouragement then may it be to Chriſtians in poverty to ſee Chriſt their Captain ſo exceeding poor, that was Lord of all the riches of the world? may not every poor Chriſtian ſay to himſelf, as he to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. The ſervant is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Maſter. The old Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could comfort themſelves to think that nature was contented with very little, and it was not much that they wanted; and ſhall not Chriſtians comfort themſelves to think that all treaſures are hid and laid up for them in Chriſt their Head? the Popes <hi>unholy holineſs</hi> that ſtiles himſelf the ſervant of Gods ſervants, advanceth himſelf above all his Lieutenants: But ſeeing Chriſt (his Maſter as he ſaith) was ſo poor, it is ſtrange he cometh to be ſo rich; and ſeeing Chriſts Kingdom was not of this world, as himſelf confeſſeth, I wonder whence <hi>Peter</hi> had ſuch a large Patrimony to leave to his ſucceſſours.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch was the humility of Chriſt, that he rejected honour when it was offered him,
<note place="margin">John 6.15.</note> hiding himſelf when he was ſought to be made
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170344:134"/>a King; he that ſaith My Kingdom is not of this world, refuſeth the offer of an earthly Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His moderation in all his geſtures and carriage, ſhews his great humility. Though Chriſt were a Prince, yet when he was born he was lapt in homely clouts; and leſt this might be imputed to the poverty of his Parents during his minority, when he was a man, he wore a ſeamleſs coat; yea in his time, it was thought that it was the prerogative only of great perſonages in Princes Courts to wear ſoft raiment. Likewiſe we may truly ſay, that he was a mourner all his daies; for though he had <hi>facultatem ridendi,</hi> as every man hath, yet we never read that he laught, but he wept often, and that not for himſelf; in him there was no cauſe of tears; he wept for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the peoples hearts,
<note place="margin">Non propter deſtructio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem domo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſed perditionem animarum.</note> 
                  <hi>Marke</hi> 3.5. and wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 19.41. not ſo much for the deſtruction of their houſes, as the perdition of their ſouls: Shall Jeſus weep for us, and ſhall not we weep for our ſelves and for our children, and for the diſhonours done to ſo pitiful a Saviour? His humility likewiſe was diſcovered by the words that he ſpake, the people wondring at the gratious words that came out of his mouth: his words were but few; he ever ſpake very ſparingly, and all his words were without oſtentation or affectation, and in his anſwers he was very conciſe, and full to the purpoſe in all kinds, as appeareth by his behaviour and carriage, both ſtanding at
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170344:134"/>the bar to be judged by the High-Prieſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.63, 64. and his ſitting at bench to judge the woman taken in adultery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.6, 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The miracles that he wrought, and the works that he did do in a moſt lively manner, ſet forth his humility to us; When he healed the ſick, cleanſed the lepers, opened the eyes of the blind, he charged moſt of them that they ſhould tell it to no man;
<note place="margin">Mat. 9.30.</note> leſt any thing ſhould be aſcribed to him, as if he were ambitious of vain-glory,
<note place="margin">Luk 5.14.</note> therefore he attributeth all to his Father: The words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf; And the works that he did he diſowneth: but the Father that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me, he doth the works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding Chriſt charged the leper that was cleanſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. that he ſhould tell it to no man: <hi>Marke</hi> tells us, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently publiſhed the matter,
<note place="margin">Mark. 1.45</note> which cauſed ſuch a throng and preſs about our Saviour, as he could not openly enter into the Cities, and follow his function. Here a queſtion may be propounded, whither this leper did well or ill in this fact? <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 107.32</note> Let men exalt the Lord in the congregation of the people, and praiſe him in the aſſembly of the Elders:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 12.4.</note> and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> bids us proclaim his name, and declare his doings among the people; and when our Saviour had diſpoſſeſſed a man of a Legion of devils, he bade him to go home, and ſhew the matter to his friends, what great things the Lord had done for him, and how he had compaſſion on him, <hi>Marke</hi> 5.19. And it is like this man meant no more.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:170344:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A particular precept coming in place, diſpenſeth with the general rule. And further I anſwer, that a good intention cannot excuſe a bad action, as is diſobedience, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.22, 23. we may gueſs at many reaſons why Chriſt bids him to tell it to no man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, a time for all things; and the time that he would have this manifeſted was not yet come, as he told his mother, <hi>John</hi> 2.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non erat neceſſe ut ſcrmone jaciaret, quod corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re praefere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</hi> Hieron in loc.</note> There was no need in words to publiſh what his cleanſed body (being as it were all turned to tongue) evidently declared.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was abſurd and prepoſterous he ſhould boaſt of his cleanſing, before he was judged clean; therefore in the next words, he is bid to go and ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt; and if then he judged him clean, he might declare it to whom he liſted: this he was to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To confirm the truth of the miracle, they ſeeing it to be no phantaſtical deluſion, but a true cleanſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he might enjoy the benefit of his cure, and be again admitted into the ſociety of other men, which muſt not be till the Prieſt judged him clean, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. Here then you ſee that Chriſt in the Sermons that he preacht, and in the miracles that he wrought, ſought not his own glory, but the glory of him that ſent him. And how humble was he in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, taking little Children to him, ſhewing that he that received a little child in his name received him?</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſufferings of Chriſt, were either ſuch as he endured in the courſe of his life, or thoſe that he ſuſtained at or near the time of his death; in all which you may ſee his great humility.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, his whole life from his birth to his death, from his cradle to his coffin was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Tragedy, yea as it were one long continued act of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>To begin with his infancy, he's no ſooner born into the world, but cruel King <hi>Herod</hi> goes about to bereave him of his life, which that he might the better effect, he cunningly enquired the place of his birth, and having learnt for the general that it was at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to learn in what houſe there, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion that he would worſhip him, when he intended nothing but treachery and his deſtruction: and being defeated of this his cruel purpoſe by God himſelf, he makes a moſt mercileſs maſſacre of all the infants males of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> under two years old,
<note place="margin">Praeſlat Herodis eſſe ſuem quam filiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> yea and (as ſome ſay) of one of his own ſons that was nurſed there, where-upon it grew into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>That it was better be</hi> Herods <hi>ſwine then his ſon:</hi> thus the Lord of life is fain to fly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170344:136"/>he can go, to eſcape death. Afterwards, he that was the Lord of Glory lived in an eſtate of contempt, reproach, and ignominy. Nay more then this, he cannot be let alone, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be quiet and ſleep in a whole skin as we ſay, even in this poor and mean eſtate of his: but he's aſſaulted at all ſides. Firſt, by the devil himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. who moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets upon him with three hot encounters as hoping to prevail upon him, becauſe he was weak with his long faſting; but his skill failed him. Then the Maſter of Fenſe himſelf being foiled, he ſets his Imps and inſtruments to work upon him, and that in divers ſorts and kinds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they perſecute him with their tongues, reviling him, and railing upon him, giving him moſt taunting terms, calling him a drunkard, and a glutton, a friend of Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that he was an Impoſtor, Cheater, and Deceiver of the people, yea that he was mad, and had a Devil, and caſt out Devils by <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub:</hi> nor are they content with prating againſt him, but they will alſo practiſe againſt him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, without any open violence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him before their Conſiſtory, and bring him <hi>coram</hi> in their Eccleſiaſtical Court, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and accurſing both himſelf and all his followers, or that did but confeſs him, or profeſs themſelves to believe on him: likewiſe they call a Council againſt him,
<note place="margin">John 7 49. John 9.22. Joh. 11.47.</note> as if he had been an arch-heretick. Nay further, they even proceed to uſe violence towards him,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170344:136"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 4.29. where his unkind Country-men go about to tumble him down headlong from a ſteep hill. <hi>Item,</hi> John 7.45. the High-Prieſts and Phariſees ſend their officers for him: nay more, they even go about to ſtone him, <hi>John</hi> 10.31. Moreover treacherous <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his ſervant to attend him, a Serjeant to apprehend and attach him, of his purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer a purſevant, and he is hired thereto with a very baſe bribe, and that not offered, but asked; not paid, but only promiſed as is conceived, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.15. They carry and recarry him from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from place to place; and when <hi>Herod</hi> would have acquitted him, they ſtill cry out againſt him, and continue accuſing him, yea even prefer a murtherer before him: and having prevailed with <hi>Pilate,</hi> they ſhew him no pitty, but execute him with all mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs cruelty and rigorous extremity, making him to carry his own Croſs as long as he is able to ſtand under it, <hi>John</hi> 19.17. Being come to the place of his execution, they hang him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Thieves and notorious malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, as if he had been a Maſter of miſ-rule, and ring-leader in routs and riots, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.38. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.33. Thus our Lord Jeſus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. Such was his humility, that though he were the God of Angels, yet by his ſufferings he was made lower then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Nor do his enemies content

You may be too high, but can never be too humble. But this is not enough, there muſt be humility as well as humiliation: a man may be humbled, and yet not be an humble man: Gods judgements humbled <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſeveral times, but his heart was not humble, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hard as ever. So <hi>Ahab</hi> was humbled; he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth upon his fleſh, and faſted and lay in ſackcloth, and went ſoftly; his very pace was altered: ſo that God himſelf takes notice of it: for, ſaith he to the Prophet:
<note place="margin">1 Reg. 21.29.</note> Seeſt thou how <hi>Ahab</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth himſelf before me? yet all this while <hi>Ahab</hi> was not humble; for in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you read, that he will go up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> to battel, let God ſay what he will to the contrary. Poverty and miſery may break a proud mans ſtomack, but not his heart; he may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170344:139"/>be as ſtubborn againſt God as ever; inwardly proud, though outwardly humbled. There is an humility likewiſe that is not good; a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit humility, when a man is only externally and complementally humble, his ſpeeches, his geſtures, his carriage, are humble, but his heart is full of pride. This was <hi>Abſaloms</hi> humility, who roſe up early and ſtood beſide the way of the gate,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Adoravit vulgus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was ſo, that when any man came nigh to him, to do him obeyſance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kiſſed him: why was <hi>Abſalom</hi> thus humble? was it not to get applauſe from the people, and to ſteal away the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the end to ſet up himſelf in the throne of <hi>David</hi> his Father? A proud man like the Lion, coucheth and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall into his ſtrong paws, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.10. as one renders that place. This is called by one <hi>Vulpina humilitas,</hi> the Foxes humility. One compareth theſe to the little venemous ſerpent <hi>Ceraſtes,</hi> which to allure the birds to come unto it, that ſhe may feed on them, counterfeits her ſelf to be dead: So theſe proud counterfeits, ſeem to be very lowly and officious, putting their hands under your very feet, when as their hearts are full of pride and covetouſneſs: Pride in it ſelf is very odious, therefore it labours to ſhrowd and palliate it ſelf under the mask of humility.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of outward humility, a voluntary humility, that is, of ſuch as vow voluntary poverty, and ſeem to renounce and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170344:139"/>relinquiſh the world, and betake themſelves to a Monaſtical and Eremetical kind of life; ſuch as theſe have no warrant for it; that I can find; our Saviour indeed pronounceth a bleſſing upon the poor; not on thoſe that are outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor in eſtate,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.3.</note> but on thoſe that are poor in ſpirit, that have mean thoughts of themſelves, from which theſe men are far enough, placing an opinion of merit in theſe courſes: Nor are they truly poor; for howbeit they have the poſſeſſion of nothing, yet they enjoy and have the command of more then they that have lands and livings, large rents and revenues: of ſuch kind of Cattel, <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> ſaid, that he had three wonders in one City; meaning three Monaſteries; whereof the Friars of one had Children, but no Wives:

               <p>But true humility is a grace ſeated in the mind or heart, whereby a man from a right knowledge of himſelf walks humbly with God and man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will make a man diſclaim all his own worth and excellencies in Gods preſence; it will make a man willing to be debaſed, that God may be glorified;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.14, 20, 21.</note> it will make men of honour, to lay aſide their own honour to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170344:140"/>honour God; as <hi>David</hi> when he laid aſide his Princely robe, and put on a linnen Ephod, and daunced before the Ark of the Lord, though his wife <hi>Michal</hi> upbraided him with it as a thing too low and baſe for his dignity; yet ſaith he, <hi>it was before the Lord, and therefore if I have been vile, I will yet be more vile then thus, and will be baſe in mine own ſight.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ſaith, he is more aſtoniſht at <hi>Davids</hi> dauncing,
<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> then at <hi>Davids</hi> fighting: for in fighting he overcame but his enemy, but in dauncing he overcame himſelf.</p>
               <p>Humility makes a man zealous in ſerving God, and yet when he hath done what he can, he accounts all as nothing: though he hath done much, yet humility ſaith I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

<note place="margin">The hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man knows, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are ſharp and bitter arrows, yet they are ſhot from a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be endured. 1 Sam. 15.26.</note> I have done that which was my duty to do. Many pretend to be Gods ſervants, but the humble man alone is the man that can be content to ſerve God in a mean place or low calling. The humble man is wiſe to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, not daring to rifle Gods Cabinet, or too curiouſly to ſearch for things too high and too wonderful for him.</p>
               <p>The humble man quietly bears the yoke, and is very ſenſible of the hand of God when it is upon him, and cannot complain of Gods diſpenſation towards him. If the Lord ſay (ſaith humble <hi>David</hi>) I have no delight in thee; behold here I am, let him do to me
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170344:140"/>as ſeemeth good unto him: He lays his hand upon his mouth when the Lord ſmites him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis his doing.</p>

<note place="margin">Matth. 15.26, 27.</note> I deſire not to ſit at table with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor to be fed either before the Children or with the Children; a ſcrap or crumb will ſerve me a poor Gentile, I deſire not a loaf, but a crumb of bread: I leave thy great mercies and great miracles for thy own country-men, thy peculiar people the Jews: but Lord, I beſeech thee ſhew one mercy to me a poor Gentile, do one little miracle for my ſake, caſt out one devil out of my poor daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſpare one crumb of mercy upon me a poor <hi>Canaanite:</hi>

               <p>Humility will make a man patiently bear and put up much contempt and reproach from others, which they caſt upon him: he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth no man but himſelf, regards not the contempt that others pour upon him: every croſs word or reproach gives the proud heart a deep wound, whereas the humble ſoul can bear reproach without regret.

               <p>Humility makes a man not greedy of praiſe from others, nor take content in it when others praiſe him: the humble man thinks ſo meanly of himſelf, that he deſires none ſhould think or ſpeak highly of him:

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170344:142"/>and uſe this grace every day more and more: we put on and pull off our apparel every day, but having once put on humbleneſs of mind, we muſt never put it off again; our apparel is the worſe for wearing, but humility doth grow and encreaſe by being uſed: God giveth grace upon grace to the humble ſoul; where humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, he giveth more grace. Humility is a grace of ineſtimable value; it is rarely found among men of honour and greatneſs; but it is a choice grace where ever it is: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as that Rhetoritian being askt what was the chiefeſt thing in eloquence, anſwered, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation; and being thrice askt, did ſtill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſame: ſo of all the graces of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, if you ask never ſo often which is the chiefeſt; I anſwer ſtill, humility is the chief of all.
